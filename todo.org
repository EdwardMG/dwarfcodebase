- [x] 3d array
- [x] set value in 3d array
- [x] respond to command line arguments
- [x] read from file
- [x] write to file
- [x] read/write 3d array of structs (obviously a shorthand, maybe semicolon delimited? you need coordinate, label, action, type
      actually, probably more like label:type:action, and just let the linenumber be the index of the array, especially since it's
      defined as a flat array in reality, you just loop over every line
- [x] respond to command line write and label
- [x] tie into a vim mode
- [x] descend and ascend depth
- [x] don't allow moving location offmap (either beyond max or below min...)
- [x] vim mode to open files as it goes over labeled entries
- [x] erase label
- [x] if labels appear next to each other, it might be nice to draw a `-` or `|` to make visual connections easy to see
      did this for between cols and it looks nice, but there is no spacing between rows to put it without making it ugly
- [x] redraw popup on change buffer
- [x] remainder of alphabete for setting labels (after this it's pretty much usable!)
- [x] conf file for setting location of fortressmap (dftest) and maybe the path to make the executable to
  - [x] I would like also to change the fortress name by a '.dwarfrc or something
- [x] fix the Makefile (not writing to the correct path?)
      It was fine, just needed to chmod it to have write permissions

stretch
- [ ] it could be nice to have line number and column as well?
