really useful function for string concatonation
  > snprintf(path, 255, "%s%c%s", getenv("HOME"), '/', "dftest");

print location... not printf, formatted print to file
  > fprintf(f, "%d", l[0]);

C bullshit where we subtract '0' to get an int from a char
atoi expects a string so it's not convenient for us
  > l[0] = line[0] - '0';

we can fscanf to do something like a regular expression
pushing matches into buffers, really cool! although there's
probably exploits since we don't say the length
oh, we can limit how much it scans by putting a number before the type
that should be safe enough
  > char key[BL];
  > char value[BL];
  > fscanf(f, "%20s %254s", key, value);
